# Area_of_polygon_uni_project
```diff
Languages used: R
```

The task for this project was to write a function to plot a polygon and find its area, given the coordinates of its
vertices. 

This project was completed almost entirely with R, and there was plenty of pen-and-paper maths for the logistics. A lot of statistics was used in the planning and execution of this task and R was a great environment for the code.

Included is the final PDF and the R markdown file.
